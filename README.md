# School Attendance Management System

## Overview

This C program provides a simple attendance management system for schools, allowing students and teachers to sign up, log in, and manage attendance for two subjects: Computer Programming and Physics. The program supports basic operations for managing student data, logging in users, and calculating attendance percentages.

## Features

- **Student Sign Up**: Allows new students to register with a unique username and password.
- **Teacher Sign Up**: Allows new teachers to register with a unique username and password.
- **Student Login**: Provides authentication for students to access their attendance data.
- **Teacher Login**: Provides authentication for teachers to manage attendance.
- **Attendance Management**:
  - Teachers can input attendance data for Computer Programming and Physics.
  - Students can view their attendance percentages for both subjects.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o my_program ams.c
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./my_program
   ```

   - **Teacher Sign Up**: Register a new teacher.
   - **Student Login**: Log in as a student to check attendance.
   - **Teacher Login**: Log in as a teacher to manage attendance.

## Code Structure

- **`main.c`**: Contains the main logic for user interactions and attendance management.
- **`functions.c`**: Implements functions for user sign-ups, logins, and attendance handling.
- **`functions.h`**: Header file for function prototypes used in `functions.c`.

## Example

**Student Login and Attendance Check:**
1. After logging in, choose between checking attendance for Computer Programming or Physics.
2. Enter the roll number and view the attendance percentage.

**Teacher Login and Attendance Management:**
